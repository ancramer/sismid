## Ensembles

- Combine many different forecasts into a single prediction

## Why ensemble?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Models are specialists: you want all the perspectives
    - different data sources
    - different philosophies, e.g. more mechanistic or more statistical approaches
    - different methodologies and parameterizations
:::

## Why ensemble?

"Whole is greater than sum of parts"

   - Average of multiple predictions is often (not always) more performant than any individual model
   
      - History in weather & economic forecasting
      
      - Seen this in infectious disease forecasting

        - "Forecast challenges": Ebola, dengue, flu, COVID-19...

## Ensemble methods: how to average?

## Ensemble methods: to weight or not?

   - Weight models by past forecast performance
   
      - e.g. using forecast scores
      
   - Rarely better than equal average
   
      - lots of uncertainty in weight estimation!

## Collaborative modelling

### "Forecast hubs"

- Crowdsourcing forecasts

   - Open source collaborative projects 

   - Anyone able to contribute a forecast
   
- Forecasts ensembled into a single projection
   
- Also enables consistent evaluation

## 

Infectious disease forecasting hubs have grown in popularity over the last decade

1. Create unweighted and weighted ensembles using forecasts from multiple models.
2. Evaluate the forecasts from ensembles compared to their constituent models.

### Which Model to Use?

There are *many* types of models available to us, (you've already seen a lot now):

-   A range of choices from mechanistic to purely statistical.

-   Bayesian, frequentist, machine learning.

-   Stochastic vs. Deterministic

How should we decide which model(s) to incorporate for nowcasting and forecasting? 

What outputs and features do we require of these models?


### Using Data the Data to Help Inform your Modeling Choices

Often, what motivates one's modeling choices is the *data* and *patterns* observed in the data.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#![](figures/wili_timeseries.png){fig-align="center"}
library("nfidd")
library("fable")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("epidatr")
data(flu_data)
flu_data <- flu_data |>
  filter(epiweek <= "2017-08-27") # Filter to start of 2017/2018 season
ggplot(flu_data) +
  geom_path(aes(x=epiweek, y=wili)) + 
  ggtitle("wILI to 2017/2018 Season")
```

### Seasonality

A seasonal pattern may suggest autocorrelation in the time series data.

```{r}
flu_data |> feasts::gg_season(wili, 
                              period = "year",
                              labels = "right",
                              labels_right_nudge = 5,
                              labels_repel = T) +
  ggtitle("Seasonality in ILI")
```

### Time-series Regression Models

For now, we'll focus on **time-series regression models**.

One widely applicable model type are the ARIMA models. ARIMA or autoregressive integrated moving average models capture patterns such as trends and autocorrelation:

- AR (Autoregressive): Uses past values to predict current ones.
- I (Integrated): Applies differencing to make the series stationary.
- MA (Moving Average): Uses recent forecast errors to refine predictions.
